## üöÄ Installation

You can install Nova tools using the methods below:

### Universal Bookmarklet Installation

The easiest way to use Nova on supported platforms (like BigIdeasMath and Achieve3000) is via our universal bookmarklet.

**How to Install:**
1.  **Visit the Nova Hub**: Navigate to our official website: [Nova Learning Suite Hub](https://cpmjaguar1234.github.io/nova/) (This is the page we've been working on!).
2.  **Drag the Bookmarklet**: On the site, find the "Nova <i class="fas fa-magic"></i>" button in the "Universal Nova Bookmarklet" section. Click and drag this button to your browser's bookmarks/favorites bar.
3.  **Use**: When you're on a supported learning platform (e.g., `bigideasmath.com` or `achieve3000.com`), simply click the "Nova" bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar to activate the assistant for that page.

### IXL Extension Installation

For an enhanced IXL experience, install our dedicated browser extension.

#### <i class="fab fa-chrome"></i> Google Chrome Installation
1.  **Download**: Get the latest version from the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/Cpmjaguar1234/nova/releases). (Look for `v1.0.0` or newer).

3.  **Open Extensions Page**: In Chrome, type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter.
4.  **Enable Developer Mode**: Find the "Developer mode" toggle (usually in the top-right corner) and turn it ON.
5.  **Load Unpacked**: Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder where you extracted the extension files.
6.  **Verify**: The Nova IXL Extension should now appear in your list of extensions and be active.

#### <i class="fab fa-firefox-browser"></i> Mozilla Firefox Installation
1.  **Visit Add-ons Page**: Go to the [Nova IXL Extension page on Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nova-ixl-extension/).
2.  **Add to Firefox**: Click the "Add to Firefox" button.
3.  **Confirm**: Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

* Ensure your browser allows bookmarklets and extensions to run.
